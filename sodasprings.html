 <h2>Winter storms forecast to hit East Idaho</h2>
 <h3>By Kendra Evensen For the Journal  Mar 6, 2019 </h3><br><hr><br>
 <p>February saw record-breaking snowfall in at least four Idaho cities and it appears that Old Man Winter isn&rsquo;t finished yet.</p>
<p>National Weather Service officials say another series of winter storms will hit this week, beginning Tuesday night.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t expect conditions to as bad as they were last week, but they&rsquo;re predicting several inches of snow to fall in the mountains every 24 hours for a few days and a mixture of rain and snow to fall in the lower elevations.</p>

<p>They issued a special weather statement for Emigration Summit, St. Charles, Montpelier, Georgetown, Grace, Soda Springs, Henry, Bone, Wayan, Swan Valley, Victor, Island Park, Kilgore, Dubois, Spencer, Edie School and Small on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A series of winter storms will advance through the eastern Idaho mountains beginning late Tuesday night and continue through Saturday. Each storm will bring 3 to 7 inches of accumulating snowfall to the mountains Wednesday and Thursday, with lesser amounts for Friday,&rdquo; according to the special weather statement. &ldquo;Colder temperatures spread across the region Friday evening with a chance of light to moderate snowfall continuing through the day Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They added that there would also be a slight chance of snow Saturday night through Monday.</p>
<p>Officials expected similar conditions in the central Idaho mountains this week.</p>
<p>In addition, weather officials said the winter storms will also affect the northwestern portion of the Snake River Plain and central mountain valleys. They issued a special weather statement for Shoshone, Richfield, Carey, Mud Lake, INL, Craters of the Moon, Howe, Arco, Mackay, Chilly, Hailey, Bellevue and Picabo on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Each storm in that area is expected to drop 1 to 3 inches of accumulating snowfall in the valleys on Wednesday and Friday, and lesser amounts could fall on Thursday, according to the weather statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colder temperatures will spread through the area Friday night and continue through Saturday with just a slight chance of snow for Saturday,&rdquo; according to the weather statement.</p>
<p>The moisture will add to Idaho&rsquo;s snowpack, which has received a significant boost in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Island Park picked up 109.9 inches of snow in February, shattering a 70-year-old record for that month. The previous February record was 78 inches of snow set in 1949, weather officials said.</p>
<p>The snow total was also one of the highest ever recorded in that area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This would also be the 3rd snowiest month all time in Island Park,&rdquo; according to the US National Weather Service Pocatello Idaho&rsquo;s Facebook page.</p>
<p>Ketchum, which received 76.2 inches of snow, broke a 1938 record of 74 inches for February, weather officials said. In addition, Picabo, 34 inches, and Swan Valley, 26 inches, also broke records of 30.5 set in 1975 and 21 set in 1976, respectively.</p>
<p>Many other local cities also reported high February snowfalls: Pocatello, 19.1 inches, had its 5th snowiest February on record; Idaho Falls, 22.2 inches, had its 2nd; Preston, 6.2 inches, had its 8th; and St. Anthony, 30 inches, and Driggs, 26.6 inches, both had their 4th.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It added snowpack, (which will) certainly help us as we work our way into the summer months,&rdquo; said Mike Huston, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service forecast office in Pocatello.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, most of Idaho&rsquo;s basins had snow water equivalents of more than 100 percent of normal. Locally, the Henry&rsquo;s Fork and Teton basins&rsquo; snow water equivalent was at 125 percent of normal, while the Snake basin above Palisades was at 113 percent and the Bear River basin was at 111 percent, according to the USDA/NRCS National Water and Climate Center.</p>

<p>The Willow, Blackfoot and Portneuf basins&rsquo; snow water equivalent was at 121 percent of normal.</p>
<p>The only basins that fell short were the Northern Panhandle region, which was at 89 percent of normal, and Spokane, which was at 91 percent of normal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good news for farmers, who weren&rsquo;t as hopeful earlier this year.</p>
<p>In early January, the Boise Basin had its 10th lowest snowpack since 1961, according to the Idaho Press. But thanks to January and February storms, that basin is now at 125 percent of normal.</p>
<p>On the flip side, the snowfall has also brought flooding concerns.</p>
<p>Some lower elevations have received rain on top of snow. With the ground still frozen, the water has had nowhere to go and has caused flooding in Bingham and Jefferson counties and other areas in recent days.</p>
<p>The Treasure Valley saw devastating floods in 2017, but officials there told the Idaho Press that the snowpack was much higher that year and they don&rsquo;t expect to see the same challenges under the current conditions.</p>
<p>Still, Bureau of Reclamation and Army Corps of Engineers have begun flood risk management operations for the Boise River, the newspaper reports.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that at this point it&rsquo;s a concern as much as it is an awareness for folks,&rdquo; Michael Coffey, spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, told the Idaho Press. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re planning to increase the discharges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There weren&rsquo;t any flood warnings in effect locally on Tuesday.</p></article></main>
